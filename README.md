# text-to-blog
Easy blogging text to html code for websites

How to run the program on any OS:
Step 1:
Open https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/ or other online python interpreter

Step 2:
Paste the code from the .py file or from https://pastebin.com/U30ch6qM to the interpreter

Step 3:
Run the code. If the output says "A module you have imported isn't available at the moment. It will be available soon."
Then remove the line from Line 1 "import os" and line 20 "os.system('cls' if os.name == 'nt' else 'clear')"

Step 4: Add your title, subtitle, and your name

Step 5: This program assumes you already have the blog with you so count the amount of paragraphs you have on your blog 
(This is optional if you want 1 continuous text, if so then you may put "1")

Step 6: Enter the text paragraph by paragraph

Step 7: Once you have a new output, Copy and paste the text and send it to me on discord

The output should start with <h1> and end with </p> like this:

<h1>Blog title</h1><h2>Subtitle</h2><h3>By Your name here</h3><p>What is Lorem Ipsum?</p><p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.</p><p>It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
